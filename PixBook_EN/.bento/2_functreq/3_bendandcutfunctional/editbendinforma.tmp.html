<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tool is used to edit the bend information that is attached to a bend line. The bend information gets attached to a bend line in one of these ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a 3D-model is created in the  3D modeller and unfolded,  automatically attaches bend information to each bend line in the unfolded drawing. (This works only if you unfold the model using true thickness; it does not work if you unfold the model as a paper model).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you use the <span class="underline">Plane Joining</span> or <span class="underline">Flange Joining</span> tools to create developments, bend information is computed and attached to the bend lines that created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When part drawing is imported from a DXF format, and there is an associated bend data file in BND format,  imports the bend information and attaches it to the bend lines as they are created.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you switch to this mode,  displays small markers on each bend line that has associated bend information. The marker visually indicates if the bend line is a mountain bend or valley bend. Clicking on such a marked line brings up the bend information inspector. Various attributes of the bend information can be edited in this inspector. The picture below shows a 3D model, its unfolded drawing with bend markers and a bend inspector being used to edit a bend line.</p>

<p>If you click on a line that is not a bend line,  confirms if you want to convert it to a bend line, and then attaches bend information to it, and brings it up for editing.</p>
