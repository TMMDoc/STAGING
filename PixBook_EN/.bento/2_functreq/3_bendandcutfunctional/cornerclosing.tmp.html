<li>
<p>The corner closer tool in sheet metal design is crucial for refining corners to meet design and manufacturability requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It addresses gaps, overlaps, and misalignments, ensuring integrity and functionality. This tool handles various corner types (open, closed, overlap, butt) and treatments (bend and corner reliefs, closures). Parameters like gap distance, overlap amount, relief shape, and fillet radius are customizable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The workflow involves selecting the corner, activating the tool, setting parameters, applying adjustments, and reviewing the results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Properly closed corners ensure fit, manufacturability, and structural integrity, enhancing design quality and reliability.
Butt corner closer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating and close butt corners in sheet metal parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A butt joint is where the ends of two pieces meet edge to edge without any overlap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This type of joint is simple and direct, often used when a clean and straightforward corner connection is needed.
Overlap corner closer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create and close over corners in sheet metal parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An overlap joint involves one piece extending over the end of another, creating a layered connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This method provides additional surface area for bonding or fastening, resulting in a stronger joint compared to a simple butt joint.
Under lap corner closer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a tool for creating and closing underlap corners in sheet metal parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an underlap joint, one piece extends under the end of another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like an overlap joint but reversed, it increases the contact area for bonding or fastening, enhancing the joint&#8217;s strength and stability.</p>
</li>
