<p>It should be possible to identify tight resp. narrow holes resp. markings in the 2D model and replace them with a slot, ie. a single cutting or marking line. The slot recognition should work for rectangles, oblongs as well as arbitrary narrow holes and markings.
Slot recognition is Boost is done as part of geometry preparation BEFORE the technology assignment. This might change in the future.</p>
