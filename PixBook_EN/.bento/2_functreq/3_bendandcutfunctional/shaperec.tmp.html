<p>The kernel should be able to recognize 2D contours against a library of known contour 2D templates and replace the identified contours in the 2D model accordingly. Shape recognition comes in two modes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Exact</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This mode replaces only exact matching contours which identifies templates from the library.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scale tolerant</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This mode replaces resp. identifies templates from the library, that match the shape, but might have a different scaling factor.
