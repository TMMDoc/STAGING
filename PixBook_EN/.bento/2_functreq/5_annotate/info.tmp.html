<p>The Info tool allows you to get the coordinate information about objects in the drawing. Click on a segment or near a node of a polyline entity and hold down the mouse button to see information about the selected segment or node. Information about the number of segments in the entire polyline, its perimeter and (if closed) its area are also displayed.</p>

<pre>Parametric editing</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hold down the Ctrl key and click on a line or arc segment to edit it parametrically. For line segments, you can edit the length and slope of the line. For arc segments, you can edit the centre point and the radius. When you edit these parameters, one end of the line or arc segment is fixed, and the other moves. The end of the line or arc that is closer to the selection point is fixed, while the other end moves.</p>

<pre>Editing regular shapes</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you parametrically edit a line or arc segment that is part of a standard shape such as a circle or a rectangle,  displays an inspector that allows you to directly modify the parameters of the shape (for example, you can change the length and width of a rectangle), instead of editing the shape one segment at a time. If the shape is part of an array, the array parameters are also available for editing.</p>

<pre>Using interlock</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are editing regular shapes parametrically, there is an option button called Interlock. Turning this on will locate all similar shapes in the drawing and will interlock all of them together, so that any changes made to the selected polyline will update all similar polylines. Suppose you want to change all 18 mm diameter circles in the drawing to 18.2 mm diameter:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hold down Ctrl and click on one of the 18 mm diameter circles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn on interlock. l Change the diameter to 18.2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click anywhere on the drawing to convert all 18 mm circles to 18.2 mm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: The interlock mode considers two shapes to be similar, if their dimensions match closely enough. The number of decimals being displayed controls this matching process; if the number of decimals being displayed is 3, then two shapes will be considered similar if their sizes are within 0.001 of each other. (You can adjust the number of decimals displayed, from the [.underline]# Options/General Program Settings# dialogue).</p>
