<p>This chapter discusses the dimensioning commands available in . Dimensioning commands are available in the drawing pane, the laser tooling pane and the punch tooling pane. In the drawing pane, you can dimension drawing geometry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the laser tooling pane, you can dimension laser tooling entities such as corner loops, approach and escape geometry etc. In the punch tooling pane, you can dimension punch geometry. When you switch between these panes, only the dimensioning that is created in that pane is displayed; dimensioning created in other panes are not displayed. Like all other commands in , dimensioning commands can be undone using the Undo menu item, or redone using the Redo menu item.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This mode is used to select dimension objects for deleting or for moving. To select a dimension object, click near the bottom of the text. If the text is centred in the dimension line, click near its centre. If the dimension line is to the right of the text, click on the bottom right of the text. If the dimension line is to the left of the text, click near the bottom left corner of the text. The figure illustrates where to click to select the dimension for different types of dimension (the small circle is the click point where you should click).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A selected dimension can be dragged by clicking on it, holding down the mouse button and moving. The effect of dragging a dimension is different in normal drawing mode, and in dimensioning mode. In drawing mode, the entire dimension moves; this should be used when the dimension has to be moved along with the object is dimensioning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="img/Mimage211.jpg" alt="image211" width="width629" height="height262"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, if a dimension is moved in normal drawing mode, it moves as a unit. If it is moved while in the dimensioning mode, only the text point is shifted.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This mode is used to create ordinate dimensions. Ordinate dimensions simply list the distance of a point from some other reference point. The first click in this mode sets the reference point, and every subsequent click creates an ordinate dimension at that point, that displays the horizontal distance between the reference point and the second point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="img/Mimage222.png" alt="image222" width="width630" height="height228"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For clarity, you should not have more than one ordinate reference in your drawing. That is, if you are using ordinate dimensions in your drawing, use one point as the reference point for all the ordinate dimensions.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These modes are similar to the Aligned dimensioning modes, in that they allow dimensions to be created at any angle. The angle in these cases is measured perpendicular from a baseline. The first click in any of these modes selects a baseline (this click must be close to a straight line segment in your drawing), and the subsequent clicks dimension the perpendicular distance between the second point and this reference line.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Radius and Center Point Radius tools are used to dimension radius&#8217;s of circles and arcs. The Center Point Radius tool draws the dimension line from the centre of the circle, while the Radius tool does not extend the dimension line to the centre of the circle. By clicking just inside or just outside the circumference of the circle or arc, the dimension can be positioned on the inside, or the outside of the circle or arc.</p>

<p>Like other dimensions, radius dimensions can be repositioned in dimension mode. The dimension leader lines are redrawn to dimension the same circle, with the text at the new position. l Setting the text position to Horizontal in the Dimension Properties dialogue (discussed next) usually leads to better looking radius and diameter dimensions.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tool automatically creates dimensions for the entire part. The dimensions created depend on the options turned on in the AutoDimension Settings dialogue box.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Generate dimensions for:</strong> Use this setting to choose whether dimensions are generated for all entities, for selected entities or for unselected entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Dimension origin:</strong> Dimensions are generated using the point specified here as the reference point. Using the lower left extent option is recommended, since it usually results in the fewest number of dimensions being created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Dimension style:</strong> Use this to choose a dimensioning style. The baseline style is recommended for most drawings, but the ordinate style can be useful in reducing clutter in very complex drawings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Outside shape:</strong> Turn this setting on to dimension irregular polylines, and outer polylines. If this is off, only regular shaped inner holes are dimensioned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Standard hole positions:</strong> Turn this on to dimension the locations of standard shaped holes. For example, in the picture above you can see that the OB 30x10 hole and the CI 10 standard shaped holes' locations are dimensioned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Standard hole descriptors:</strong> Turn this on to add descriptors (as for the obround and circle hole in the picture above) for standard hole shapes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Standard hole legends:</strong> Turn this on to add legends (A, B, C&#8230;&#8203;) for each kind of regular shaped hole. This can result in less cluttered dimensioning, especially if there are numerous similar holes in the drawing. The <span class="underline">View Legends</span> tool can be then used to view the hole chart for the drawing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Array parameters:</strong> If there are patterns of similarly shaped holes (for example, an LAA, BHC, or GRD pattern), this option displays the pattern information. This includes row and column spacing and count for a GRD pattern, or bolt hole diameter and count for a BHC pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Irregular holes:</strong> Turn this option on to add segment by segment dimensioning for irregularly shaped holes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Bend line positions:</strong> If you turn this option on, bend line positions are dimensioned (relative to the closest parallel edge of the outer shape).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Arc radius dimensions:</strong> Turn this on to annotate the radius of all arc segments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Delete old dimensions:</strong> Turn this option on to delete existing dimensions in the drawing before auto dimensioning. This is recommended, because otherwise the automatically created dimensions could visually interfere with the existing dimensions. You should always run the AutoDimension tool first, and then create any other custom dimensions later.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This button is used to zoom in and out of a drawing. Here are different ways in which the zoom mode can be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type in a zoom factor and press Enter. The centre of the drawing remains unchanged, while the drawing itself is scaled by the factor you enter. Factors less than 1 zoom out, while factors greater than 1, zoom in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click, hold down the mouse button and drag. This displays a rubber band rectangle on the screen that defines the area of interest and when you release the mouse button that area expands to fill the entire window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold down Ctrl and click, to zoom back to your previous view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold down Shift and click to zoom back to the extents of the entire drawing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold down Alt and click to zoom out by a factor of 0.5</p>

<pre>Other navigation mechanisms</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the zoom command on the drawing editor toolbar, there are some other methods in which you can navigate about the drawing:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pressing Ctrl+E at any time (even halfway through a command) will cause  to zoom out so that the entire drawing area is visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressing Ctrl+W at any time (even halfway through a command) will cause  to temporarily suspend that command, and switch into a zoom mode. The prompt bar at this time will read "Click, drag and release to zoom in and resume the previous command". After you have clicked, dragged and released to define an area of interest,  will zoom in and the command will resume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a mouse with a mouse wheel, you can also use the mouse wheel to zoom and pan. To zoom in, roll the wheel forward, and to zoom out, roll the wheel backward. To pan the drawing without changing the zoom level, click the mouse wheel, and drag the mouse while holding the mouse wheel down. These navigation modes can be used at any time, even when you are halfway through a command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click this button to request for a repaint of the screen. This may be sometimes needed to remove blips, or markers, left behind on the screen by an earlier command. Also, when you delete an entity that coincides with another entity, the second entity may not be seen until you click the redraw button.</p>
