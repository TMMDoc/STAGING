<p>The Vectorize TrueType tool is used to take the shapes of characters in any TrueType font, and convert them into polylines. Laser tooling can then be applied on these polylines and they can be cut. The first time this button is clicked, the Font dialogue comes up, allowing you to choose the font to be used for the text. Subsequently, when you use this tool, the same font is used. If you want to pick a different font, you can click the Pick button to choose another font.</p>

<p>For best results, use large font sizes (100 and above). If you want to create very small text, it is better to create it using a large font, and later use 's scale command to reduce it to size, rather than using a small sized font. The Tolerance parameter can also be used to fine-tune the conversion of TrueType characters to polylines. When a TrueType character is converted, spline curves in the character are converted to a series of straight-line segments. The tolerance parameter specifies the maximum acceptable error between the original spline, and the final output polyline segments.</p>
