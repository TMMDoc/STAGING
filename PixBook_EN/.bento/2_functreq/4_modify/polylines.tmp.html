<p>This tool is used to replace arc segments and spline curves with an approximation of straight line segments. Type in the Pitch, which sets the maximum length of the line segments that are used to approximate the curve. Then, click on a polyline or a spline curve. All the curved segments of the polyline, or the entire spline curve are replaced by the linear approximation.</p>

<p>The picture above shows a polyline and a spline curve that have been replaced by linear segments using this tool. A Pitch setting of 5 was used, and you can see that the line segments used to approximate the curve are less than this in length.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="underline">Note.</span> This tool is very useful when tooling up drawings with spline curves, because these splines must be discretized into line segments before they can be tooled up for laser or punch CAM.</p>

<p>This mode is used to create spline curves from polylines. Each vertex of the polyline becomes a control point vertex for the spline curve, and the curve is then fitted through. Open or closed polylines can be converted, as can be seen in the example below.</p>

<p>The control point polygon has been overlaid on top of the open spline curve in the example above; you can see how the control points correspond to the vertices of the original polyline. These control points can then be edited using the <span class="underline">Edit Spline</span> command to reshape the spline.</p>

<p>The Create Spline tool is an enhancement of the <span class="underline">Pline to Spline</span> . It creates a spline that passes through all the clicked points. To start a new spline, click on the start point. Now, as you click on subsequent points, the spline will be created. Depending upon the location of the fit points, the shape of the spline will change. If you want to close the spline, press the ALT key and then click. To continue and create a new spline, press SHIFT and click. Hold down the CTRL Key and click to undo the previously created spline.</p>

<p>This tool is used to reshape splines that have been imported from DXF or other files or that have been created using the <span class="underline">Pline to Spline</span> command. Click on the spline to edit, and its control point polygon is displayed. You can then click on any of the control point vertices and drag it to reshape the spline. When you are done, hold down the Ctrl key and click on another spline to start editing it (or just click on an empty area of the drawing to finish).</p>
