<p>This command is used to fill any irregular boundary area with copies of a pattern. First, draw a single seed copy of the entity to be arrayed inside the irregular boundary. Then switch to this tool, type in the row and column pitch and the rotation angle of the entire pattern. Hold down the Ctrl key and click on the entity to be copied, and then click on the boundary to fill it, as shown in the example below.</p>

<p>You can select multiple entities and fill the boundary with the entire pattern. The picture alongside shows a boundary being filled with a pattern of seven circles. Only complete copies of the pattern will be repeated; if there is room for only part of the pattern to be placed,  will not place it.</p>

<p>As the entities are copied, they are automatically grouped into rectangular arrays.  tries to group together the entities into the smallest number of rectangular arrays possible, so that efficient code can be generated for such patterns, even if they contain a large number of holes.</p>
