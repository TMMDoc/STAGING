<p>The parts of the drawing editor are tagged in the illustration alongside; most editor windows in  follow a similar layout, and have the same components that are discussed here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Toolbar:</strong> The toolbar along the left edge of the drawing contains many buttons or tools. You can pick a tool for use by clicking on it, and the selected tool appears highlighted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Group buttons:</strong> Many editor toolbars contain too many buttons to display at the same time. So, these buttons are organized into groups and only one group is visible at one time. In the picture alongside, you can see that only the Basic group is visible, and the Advanced and Dimension groups are not visible. To switch to another group, click on the group button, or hold the mouse over anywhere over the toolbar, and rotate the mouse wheel up or down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Prompt bar:</strong> Displays instructions for completing the currently chosen command. As you progress through a command, the text displayed here changes to reflect the next operation you must do. Many commands also use keys like Ctrl, Shift and Alt as modifiers to change the meaning of the command in some way. The prompt bar indicates if the current command has any modifier keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Work area:</strong> This is where your drawing takes shape. You can use the <span class="underline">Zoom</span> tool to make your work area display different parts of the drawing, or the entire drawing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Input bar:</strong> Most drawing editor commands allow you to provide input using a mouse, or by typing in numbers using the keyboard. The Input bar is the place to enter these values. One of the input boxes is always active, even if you don&#8217;t see a flashing cursor inside it. The active input box has a bolder caption than the rest (see the X input box in the figure), and you simply start typing in a number into this input box at any time. As soon as you start typing, the cursor will start flashing in the input box. You can also click on a particular input box to activate it if it is required. After you finish typing in one input, the TAB key takes you to the next input box, while the Shift+Tab key combination takes you to the previous one. After all inputs are complete, press Enter to perform the command.</p>
