<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can select entities by drawing a fence around them. To do this, click on an empty area of the drawing while holding down the Ctrl key. This point becomes the start point of the fence. Keep clicking on additional points to define the fence area. Finally, when you are done, hold down the Ctrl key and click again to select the entities that lie completely within the fenced-in area.</p>

<pre>Moving and copying using the Pick tool</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you point close to a selected entity, the cursor shape changes to a move cursor. Now you can click, drag and release to move the selected entities. If you hold down the Ctrl key when doing this, the entities don&#8217;t get moved, but get copied at the new position. All geometric snaps are available when moving or copying objects. Here&#8217;s an example with a rectangle and a circle, that shows how to move the circle so that its centre point corresponds to the centre point of the rectangle.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can select only some of the nodes of a polyline by drawing a selection rectangle around only those nodes. (The rectangle must be drawn from left to right). Then, these selected nodes alone can be moved, changing the shape of the polyline. Here&#8217;s an example, in which the rectangle should be stretched horizontally, until its right edge passes through the centre of the circle.</p>

You can type in and X and Y offset amount into these boxes, and press Enter to move or stretch the selected entities. If you hold down the Ctrl key when pressing Enter, a copy is made, and the copy is moved or stretched.</p>
