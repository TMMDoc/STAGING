<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tool is used to trim and join several separate polylines into one. Select this mode, and click on the pieces of the polyline to be connected and retained. The locations where you click on the polylines determines which section of the polyline is trimmed away and which are kept. Here is an example that shows a closed polyline being constructed from four separate segments.</p>

<p>The Offset tool is used to make a copy of an polyline, with each of its segments offset so it lies parallel to the original.

<p>This dialogue is used to parametrically create one of several common shapes and insert them into the drawing. When you click on this button, the common shape construction dialogue shown alongside appears. In the top pane of this dialogue, you can choose from the palette of common shapes listed. When you choose a shape, a descriptive picture of the shape is displayed, and you can type in values into the parameter boxes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to creating a single shape, this tool can also create arrays of common shapes, laid out in different patterns such as BHC, LAA, GRD etc. The bottom pane lets you choose one of these patterns and to input its parameters. After choosing a shape and a pattern, and entering parameters for both of them, the common shape can be created by clicking at the desired insertion point in the drawing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use this tool to move selected objects through a precise distance. The distance to move can be typed into the DX and DY input boxes, and when you press Enter, all selected objects move through this distance. If you also hold down Ctrl key when you press Enter, a copy is made, and the objects at the original positions are undisturbed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also define the distance to be moved by clicking twice with the mouse. Objects are moved by the vector between the first and second mouse clicks. For example, if you click at the points (20, 10) and (24, 16), selected objects are moved 4 units to the right, and 6 units to the top.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the prompt indicates, you can redefine the selection set of objects without getting out of this mode, by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking on an object you want to select. Like in the Pick mode, the Shift key must be held down if you want to select further objects without deselecting the ones you have already selected, and clicking on an empty area of the drawing allows you to select objects by enclosing them in a selection rectangle. After the selection is done, you can continue with the Move/Copy operation by clicking without holding down the Ctrl key. This mechanism of selecting objects without having to revert back to Pick mode works in several other modes, such as Rotate, Scale, Mirror, Rectangular Array, and Circular Array.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Rotate tool is used to rotate the selected entities. Any point can be used as the centre of rotation by either clicking on it, or typing it into the X and Y input boxes, and you can rotate entities through precise angles by typing in the rotation angle into the Angle input box. If you want to enter the rotation angle using the mouse, you do it by clicking on two points. The angle these two points form at the centre of rotation is used as the rotation angle. Here&#8217;s an example.</p>

<p>Holding down the Ctrl key during the first click of the Rotate command has the effect of redefining the selection set, while the Ctrl key during the last click acts as a modifier, causing a rotated copy to be made, leaving the original intact. The prompt bar at the top of the drawing window changes to indicate the meaning of the Ctrl key in the current context.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the Scale tool, you can make selected objects larger or smaller. The shape of the object is preserved, since the same scaling is used on both the X and Y axes. As with the rotation tool, you can designate any point as the centre of scaling; the selected entities scale up or down about this point. You can enter the scale factor by typing it into the Factor input box. Scale factors lesser than 1 diminish the entities, while scale factors greater than 1 enlarge it. You can also input the scaling factor using two mouse clicks. Suppose the distance between the centre of scaling and the first mouse click is d1, and the distance between the centre of scaling and second mouse click is d2, the scaling factor is computed as d2 / d1. The example below illustrates how to use a mouse to input scaling factors. In this example, we want to scale the triangle so that its base fits precisely on top of the rectangle.</p>

<p>The Mirror tool is used to make mirror images of selected entities, about any arbitrary reflection line.

The example below shows an entity being mirrored about various lines.</p>
