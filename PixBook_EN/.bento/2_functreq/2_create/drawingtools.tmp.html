<p>The Line tool has a special assist mode to help you draw a line that is tangential to two arcs. (In this case, using any of the other modes of drawing this line is difficult, since both the endpoints of the line are not known, and depend on the tangency relationship). To use this mode, switch to the Line tool, and move near the arc until you get an on snap. (If you get an endpoint, midpoint or other snap, move further along the arc until the on snap appears). Click to set the first point of the line. Then, move the mouse in an approximately tangential direction to the arc.  will understand that you want to draw a tangent line, and will start sliding the first point along the arc, always maintaining tangency to the current mouse position. Drag until you get a tangent snap on the other arc or circle, and click again to set the line in position.</p>

<p>This tool is used to draw a series of connected line or arc segments. Each line or arc is drawn starting from the endpoint of the previous line or arc. Arcs are drawn by holding down the Ctrl key as you drag, and start off at a tangent to the previously drawn segment. (Therefore, at least one line segment must be drawn before you can draw an arc using the Ctrl key). Here&#8217;s an example of one way to draw a rounded rectangle using the Connected Lines tool:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use this tool to draw a circle that has a known radius, and passes through two given points. It can also be used to draw circles where the two give points line on opposite ends of a diameter. If the Radius input box is set to 0, the two points entered are considered the endpoints of a diameter. The centre point lies at the midpoint of these two points, and the circle is drawn to pass through the two points. If the Radius value is non-zero, a circle with the specified radius, and passing counter-clockwise through the two specified points is drawn. Here is an example of how to draw a circle, if we know two points that lie on a diameter.</p>

<p>You can use this tool to draw an arc by specifying its centre point, start point and the end point. The first click of the mouse sets the centre point. The second click fixes the start point (and therefore the radius) of the arc. The third point determines the end point. The arc is always drawn counter-clockwise from the start point to the end point. (If the end point you specify is not at the same distance from the centre as the start point is,  constructs an imaginary line from the centre to the end point, and stops the arc where it would meet this imaginary line.).

For example, if the three entities selected are themselves circles which are non-intersecting, there are 8 possible circles that can be drawn. The points where you click decide which of these possible circles is actually drawn. The one that is drawn is the one that is closest to all the three points you select.</p>
