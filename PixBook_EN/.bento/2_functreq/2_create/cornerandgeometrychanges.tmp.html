<p>These tools operate on a corner of a polyline, and transform it. After you select the tool, click close to the corner of the polyline. These tools work only if the two segments meeting at the corner are straight-line segments (An exception is the fillet tool, which can fillet the corner between a line and an arc segment). The Chamfer and Corner Step tools take two distances as inputs: Distance1, and Distance2. Distance1 is measured from the corner, along the segment your click is closer to, so clicking closer to one or the other segment meeting at the corner has different results. (Compare B and C, F and G in the example below). Similarly, the AntiFillet tool draws its arc differently depending on whether you click just inside the corner, or just outside. (Compare D and E in the example below).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These tools are used to cut different types of notches into straight-line segments. The end of the line segment you click closer to gets notched. The notch lies to the left or the right of the line segment, depending on whether you click to the left of the line, or the right of the line. All these tools use an Offset parameter to decide how far from the corner the notch should start. The Edge Recess tool is used to cut a rectangular notch. The Edge U-Cut tool is used to cut a rectangular notch, with rounded corners. The Edge V-Cut tool is used to cut a triangular notch. If you enter the Depth,  computes the angle at the apex of the triangle. Conversely, you can enter the angle and the depth will be computed. As the mouse is moved over, the outline of the result that will be created is shown. You can then click to create the notch.</p>

<p>The figure shown below illustrates how the click point affects the position and orientation of the notch.</p>

<p>The Trim tool is used to cut away pieces of an entity. Entities are trimmed against their intersection points to other entities. If the segment of the entity that you click on does not intersect another entity, the entire segment is removed.</p>

<p>As you can see, the trim tool can be used both to trim a line segment to an intersection point, or to remove an entire segment. Sometimes, it is simpler to select one or more boundary entities for performing the trim operation. Boundary entities can be selected by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking on them, after you switch to Trim mode.</p>

<p>The Extend tool is the opposite of the trim tool, and is used to extend line and arc segments. It can be used to extend the first or last segments of an open polyline.

<p>When trimming an open polyline, you can hold down the Ctrl key when you pick the second trim point, to indicate the polyline should be trimmed away all the way to the end. In other words, the polyline is broken into two at the first trim point, and the half of the polyline that contains the second trim point is discarded.</p>

<p>This tool is used to divide a line or arc segment into a number of pieces, taking four inputs, Segments, Divide Length, Start offset, and End offset. The tool starts at the end of the segment closer to the clicked-at point, and places nodes dividing the segment into pieces. If the Divide Length parameter is zero, the segment is divided into a number of equal sized pieces. If the Segments parameter is zero, the segment is divided into as many pieces as it can be, based on the Divide Length parameter. The Start offset and End offset can be used to exclude the starting and ending portions of the line for the offset operation.</p>

<p>This tool is used to replace a set of straight-line segments of a polyline with circular arcs.
