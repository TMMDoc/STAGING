<p>These tools are used to perform boolean operations on closed shapes. The Union operation replaces the two entities by a new entity that contains all the area bounded by either the first entity, or the second entity, or both. The Intersection operation replaces the two entities by a new entity that contains all the area bounded by both the entities. The Subtraction operation replaces the two entities by a new entity that contains all areas contained in the first, but not in the second. Some examples will help you understand these operations better:</p>

<p>The Ctrl key is handy when you want to perform a boolean operation on more than 2 entities. Suppose you wanted to make a union of 4 entities, A, B, C and D. One way would be to make a union of A and B, then a union of C and D, and finally a union of the two resultant entities. The simpler way would be to click A, and, holding down the Ctrl key, click B, C and D.</p>
