</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tool is used to make numerous copies of entities, and arrange them in a rectangular grid. Type in values into the Columns and Rows input boxes. Then, enter the Column Pitch and Row Pitch by typing these values into the input boxes. You can also visually set the column and row pitch by clicking twice with the mouse. The horizontal and vertical distance between these two clicks define the column and row spacing.</p>

<p>After creating a rectangular array, if you use the Info tool to view information about any of the objects in the array, you will also get additional information about the number of columns, rows, the column pitch and the row pitch of the array, as the figure alongside illustrates.</p>

<p>You can hold down the Ctrl key during the first click of the rectangular array command to select an entity to array. You can hold down Shift at the same time to select additional entities.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When entering a second point using the mouse, the row and column counts you specify are used, and the second mouse position defines the row and column pitch (the row and column pitch you type in are ignored). However, if you hold down the Shift key during the first mouse click,  uses the row and column pitch you specify and as you drag the mouse, the row and column counts are modified appropriately.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The circular array tool is used to create copies of selected entities, arranged around a centre point. Select the entities to be arrayed, and set the centre point by clicking with the mouse, or typing into the X and Y boxes. Enter the number of Elements, and the Angle Step between elements, and press Enter to make the array. The Angle Step can also be input by clicking twice with the mouse. The angle formed between these two points at the centre point is used as the Angle Step.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tool is used to cluster together a set of similar entities into an array. Select all the similar entities together, and then click this button. If  is able to convert all the entities into either a rectangular or polar array, the entities are deselected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Entities that are converted into arrays usually result in more efficient code generation. Also, these arrays can be edited parametrically and it is easy to change various parameters like the number of rows, the number of columns, the row and column pitch.</p>
