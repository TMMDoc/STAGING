<p>This tool is used to offset a single segment of a polyline. The offset distance can be measured in a direction that is not necessarily perpendicular to the segment being offset. TO use this tool, enter the offset distance first, and pick a segment to indicate the direction in which the offset distance is to be measured. Then, pick the segment to offset and the offset direction.</p>
