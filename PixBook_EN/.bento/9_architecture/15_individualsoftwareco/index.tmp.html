<p>The kernel comes with a separate installation package. The installation allows the kernel to be installed on a server or client system. The installation and execution of the kernel must not be dependent on any specific technology provider, especially not on an internal reference.
The kernel should have an as-small-as-possible installation / disk space footprint.
The kernel can be updated independent of other components, especially independent of the infrastructure (TRUMPF Oseon/Boost, Lantek Integra, …) and other technology components (Bend, Laser, …).</p>
