<p>The target of this project is the implementation of a 2D kernel handling all aspects of 2D models based on the existing TMM software stack. It should be used in PIX, but also serves the purpose of a potential replacement of other 2D kernel libraries, especially for the GEO kernel in TruTops Boost. Beside PIX, it could also be integrated into other applications as a 2D engine.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The target is not to re-engineer a full blown CAD system but to have a lightweight tool which focuses on sheet metal specific functionality</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The 2D CAD functionality implemented in Flux will serve as a basic specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A OpenGL based rendering engine is used that is based closely on the Lux rendering engine used in Flux. The Pix renderer will be published as a separate component for other applications or as a separate product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UI shell of the application will be built using WPF used standard WPF principles and components (like Binding, Commands, Toolbars etc), but may later replace these with more lightweight replacements or ones better suited to long-term Metamation perspective. A design goal should be that it should be simple to move the shell UI from WPF to an alternate technology (like MAUI) in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PIX will be developed with C# and .Net8 using modern C# idioms. Code will be hosted in a Github repository. Issues will be tracked using Fogbugz. Documentation will be done using Bento. Testing will be done with a combination of a C# test suite developed alongside the application, and an external test tool (TBD) for exercising the UI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test System: A comprehensive set of regression tests, written in C# (similar to Flux.Test), with tracking of coverage right from day 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embeddable via API: Sketch should be available as an embeddable component with a clean
API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-update: Sketch should prompt the user when a newer version is available and offer
to update the installation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A Product package like Boost consists of the following sub-components which should be kept separated:
-	A CAD module line PIX which creates entities (lines, arcs, â€¦)  without technology information. A entity could be annotated with certain information for the final product.
-	A CAM system like Praxis receives drawing information, adds the technology information and organizes the production process
-	A technology module like FluxBend delivers to the CAM system the technology information on request.</p>
