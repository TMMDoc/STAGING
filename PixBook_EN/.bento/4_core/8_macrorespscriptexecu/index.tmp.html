<div class="paragraph">
<p>The kernel should support execution of macros resp. scripts, most preferable written in a standard script language like Python, TypeScript or Lua (for cloud).
Execution of such scripts serves the purpose of post- and batch-processing 2D models as well as variant programming. There are some differences between the two intentions. While the approach for post- resp. batch-processing is on executing a known set of operations on an /(flexible) selection of entities, defined by filter criteria, for variants, the set of entities is mainly known (fixed), while the parameters of the operations need to be flexible/configurable.
The following operations need to be supported:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create
Creating various entities and types of 2D geometries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move
Moving the part or a set of selected entities by a translation vector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rotate
Rotating the part or a set of selected entities around a given center by an angle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mirror
Mirroring the part or a set of selected entities on a mirroring center (coordinate system origin or a specified point) or a mirroring axis (x-axi, y-axis or a specified axis given by two points)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scale
Scaling the part or a set of selected entities on a scaling center (coordinate system origin or a specified point) by a specified scaling factor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stretch
Stretching the part or a set of selected entities by a given, in difference to move, stretch also modifies the connected entities to maintain the given connectivity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy
Copying the part or a set of selected entities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete
Deleting the part or a set of selected entities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify
Modifying the part or a set of selected entities like changing the radius of an arc or circle or the start/end point of a line</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select
Selecting a set of entities within a specified box, at a specified location or by a given id or selecting a set of entities based on filter criteria, such as “all red circles with radius smaller 5mm”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SetId
Setting the selection id for a set of entities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SetAttribute/Property
Setting attributes/properties for the part or a set of selected entities
