<p>The kernel detects splines in the 2D model and returns a warning.
It’s also required, that – if activated – the kernel converts splines into lines and arcs, if this is explicitly required or the target export file format does not support splines.
One strategy to convert splines is to approximate, this creating a sequence of lines and arcs. The sequence should remain under a given distance parameter to the B-Spline and no entity should be shorter than a given minimal length.
