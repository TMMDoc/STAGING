<p>The kernel detects open outer contours and returns an error.
It’s also required, that – if activated – the kernel closes small gaps in contours automatically. The function also allows to define the tolerance for what is considered as “small”.
The default closing mode is to close the gap in by extending the lines to form a corner. If this leads to large corners - this happens when elements are nearly parallel but not touching - the gap will be closed by inserting a simple line, connecting both identified endpoints defining the gap.
