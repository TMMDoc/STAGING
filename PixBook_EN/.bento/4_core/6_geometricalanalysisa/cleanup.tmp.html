<p>Use this tool to remove small segments from drawing. Type in a threshold value into the Min Length input box, and indicate a region of the drawing. All segments inside the region which are smaller than the threshold length are removed. When a segment is removed, gaps can appear in the remnant polyline that is left behind.  cleans up this polyline by extending these adjacent segments to meet, thus removing the gaps.</p>

<p>Hold down the Ctrl key when you define the area, to suppress the remnant clean-up. In this case, gaps will be left in the original polylines where the small segments are removed, thus splitting the original polyline into many pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Open Polylines</strong></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When drawings are created in , using proper snaps and other assists, the endpoints of adjacent segments are usually precisely aligned to each other, and  automatically stitches adjacent segments together to form continuous polylines that are more suitable for tooling. However, in some cases, especially when drawings are imported from low-accuracy DXF files or other sources, adjacent segments might not line up precisely enough for 's automatic stitching to work correctly. In this case, it might be difficult to know by visual inspection where a polylines nodes don&#8217;t meet up exactly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Mark Open Polylines tool helps fix this problem. Click on this button, and  adds highly visible red markers at the open ends of all polylines. Then, it is easy to see where the gaps are and then can be cleaned up using the editing tools. These markers are added into a special system layer called OpenNodes.  knows that all entities on this layer are just markers, and not real entities and will never add laser or punch tooling to them. Also, every time you click this button any old markers are first removed, and new markers are added. So, if you clean up the drawing perfectly to have no open polylines, and then click this button, all open polyline markers will be removed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use this command to highlight (select) duplicate segments in the part drawing. When this button is clicked,  analyses the part drawings and out of every pair of duplicate segments, one is selected. This makes it easy to delete the duplicates by just pressing the Delete key after marking the segments. Here is the result after marking duplicate segments.</p>
