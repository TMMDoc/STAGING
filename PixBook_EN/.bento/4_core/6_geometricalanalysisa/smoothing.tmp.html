<p>The kernel can simplify (“smooth”) the given 2D model, by replacing contours with simpler ones. The function allows to define several criteria parameters such as a threshold angle, a distance threshold and a minimal length.
Contours are replaced, if a new contour can be calculated, where:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>corners with more than the threshold angle remain unchanged,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the new contour doesn’t deviate more than the distance parameter from the original,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no element of the new is shorter than the given minimal length parameter and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the new contour has less elements than the original one.
