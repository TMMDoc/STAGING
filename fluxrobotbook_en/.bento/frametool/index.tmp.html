<p>The situation on the machine is often slightly different as in the offline programming (especially accuracy of the gripper etc) so the operator needs to fine adjust. To run a program in an optimized way he could tweak a frame within some millimeter.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two ways are possible:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the operator could modify the standard frames from Fanuc for a one time adaptation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is recommended to syncronize your offline programming system according to to optimization on the machine. Generating the next and all following Flux programs will benefit then from this optimization. FluxRobot comes with a tool to visualize the downloaded frames of frame.dh and will be able to read the optimized frames from the Robot back to FluxRobot</p>

</ul>
