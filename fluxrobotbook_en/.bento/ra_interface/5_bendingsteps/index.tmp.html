<p><strong>Bending cycle sequence without ACB</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First the machine is ready. The press beam speed is zero. The machine
sets the signal XS7:11 "Machine OK". To start the robot sets the signal
XS8:10 "Load bending program". The machine positions the press beam at
the upper dead point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The robot sets the signal "Position backgauge" to move the backgauge,
the lower tool displacement and the crowning. Once all auxiliary axes
are positioned, the press brake sets the output XS7:2 "Machine ready".
Now the robot can contact the sheet onto the finger sensors of the
backgauge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The robot now sets the signal XS8:6 "Approach mute point", so that the
press beam moves to the mute point (2) at rapid speed. The signal
"Approach mute point" must always remain set during this movement, since
otherwise the press beam will stop immediately. If it is necessary to
stop and wait at the mute point, then the signal "Approach clamping
point" must also be reset. The machine sets the signal XS7:3 "Mute
point" in the mute point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the robot sets the signal XS8:7 "Approach clamping point" in the mute
point (3) of the machine, then the press beam moves to the clamping
point (4) in press operation. The signal "Approach clamping point" must
always remain set during this movement, since otherwise the press beam
will stop immediately. The machine sets the signal XS7:4 "Clamping
point" in the clamping point. The press beam maintains its position
exactly here so that the sheet cannot slip out and the robot cannot
release the sheet. The backgauges also pull back in positive X
direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the robot sets the signal XS8:8 "Approach lower dead point" in the
clamping point of the machine, then the press beam moves to the lower
dead point (6) with the bending speed. The input signal "Approach lower
dead point" must always remain set during this movement, since otherwise
the press beam will stop immediately. There the machine then sets the
output signal XS7:5 "lower dead point".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So that the press beam unloads the sheet from the lower dead point (6)
with the decompression speed and the decompression path and then moves
rapidly UP to the fully upwards position, the robot must set the signal
XS8:9 "Approach upper dead point". Once the press beam has reached the
end of the unloading or decompression at point (8), then the machine
sets the output signal XS7:10 "Bend finished". There is no option to
stop via the robot. The press beam immediately moves to the upper dead
point with maximum retraction speed. Then the machine is in status 0
again and waits for a new signal sequence from the robot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Bending cycle sequence</strong> Before work can start with the angle sensors
ACB in robot <strong>with ACB and identification</strong> mode, as well as the ACB
explanation, the chapter "Bending</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>cycle sequence without ACB" must also be read and understood. Since the
comments regarding the signal flags also apply here, the explanation
mainly concentrates on the difference to the previous chapter. At the
lower dead point (7) of the prebend the output ACB bending operation
must be queried, so that the robot knows that the next correction
bending will take place using the angle measurement ACB. In this case,
the bending cycle is only finished once the signal "required angle
reached" is set, and not when the lower dead point is reached. This is
the case because after bending the press beam moves up slightly and the
angle is then measured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the complete ACB correction bending with identification, which is
shown schematically in Fig. 102647, the tilting of the bent sheet must
be compensated by the robot. For this the output signals "ACB tilting +"
and "ACB tilting -" are available. If the angle sensor ACB is not
installed rotated, then with a negative ACB tilting the robot needs to
press the sheet towards the press beam and with positive ACB tilting
push away from the press beam, until both signals are reset by the
machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The equalization of the tilting should start after the reset of the
output signal "lower dead point" at position (7) and be continued by the
machine until setting the output signal "Bend finished" at position
(10). The machine only carries out the ACB correction bending once the
tilting of the workpiece has been corrected and the signal XS8:9
"approach upper dead point" has been set again by the robot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tilting angle tolerance can be changed on the HMI.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here the sheet is only inserted once the press beam is at the mute
point and therefore the upper tool has already entered the lower tool.
This allows the sheet to be pushed directly into the upper tool by the
robot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>■ The point at which the bending step change takes place is programmed
under <em>Bending steps</em>. All backgauges, the lower tool displacement and
the crowning however are only moved once the "position backgauge" (pin
XS8:5) signal is set by the robot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Error</strong> If an error occurs on the press brake, the robot is informed via
a digital signal. The robot stops the current movement. Conversely, an
error on the robot stops the axes movement on the machine. Once the
robot is error-free and ready once more, it notifies the machine. The
error must still be acknowledged on the press brake as shown in this
flow chart (see "Fig. 113754", pg. 10‐29).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an error cannot be acknowledged either with the &lt;START&gt; button or via
a start signal, then it is acknowledged using the "PRESS BEAM UP" foot
switch, which is located within the fenced area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See XS8:4 (see "Tab. 10-2", pg. 10‐10).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The robot only resets its output "Robot OK" (XS8:4) if errors occur on
the robot axes, but not if the press brake resets its output "Machine
OK" (XS7:11).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conversely an error on the robot (XS8:4 = FALSE) triggers an error on
the press brake. It is only possible to leave the "Error</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>State" status once the robot has set its output XS8:4 once more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>|If the robot has fewer digital outputs and inputs for synchronization
with the press brake, inputs of the press brake can also be combined by
"bridging".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To synchronize the downward movement of the press brake, the following
inputs can be bridged:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>■ XS8:6 approach mute point, ■ XS8:7 approach clamping point, ■ XS8:8
approach lower dead point. "Bridged" means that the machine interprets
these signals as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>■ XS8:7 and XS8:8 also as a release to the mute point, ■ XS8:8 as
release to the clamping point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the inputs on the press brake are bridged and the outputs are not
queried in the robot program, of course the flexibility and safety of
the interface are reduced.</p>
