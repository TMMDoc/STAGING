<p>0The robot interface consists of:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>■ Two 42-pin plugs for the cable connection with the robot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>■ An input/output module with digital inputs and outputs for the control
signals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>■ A switch panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>■ An additional key switch with two positions at the rear of the
electrical cabinet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the signals for synchronization, the plug also contains
connections for the EMERGENCY STOP circuit, the enabling condition for

<p>In compliance with the safety regulations of the relevant national
standards and laws as well as the additional safety information in this
description, it is also possible to operate the TruBend Series 5000
(B23) and 7000 (B28) as usual via the operating panel with manual
loading. We differentiate between the operations "TruBend without robot" and
"TruBend with robot".</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When operating without a robot, the TruBend is loaded manually. For this
purpose, the press brake is controlled with the operating panel. This
setup status corresponds to the description in the operator&#8217;s manual of
the press brake.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the "TruBend with robot" operation mode, the operating panel must not
be removed!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you select the operating mode "TruBend with robot", the foot switch
is partially inactive, e.g. the "PRESS BEAM DOWN" foot switch has no
function. Therefore, in robot mode it is not possible to trigger a
movement of the press beam with the foot switch.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Operating-mode key switch</strong> As standard the external operating-mode key
switch is used to switch between operation with and without robot. When
doing so the operating panel remains plugged in. The material number for
the operating-mode key switch sign is 0858369.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The operating-mode key switch is located next to the On/Off switch.</p>
