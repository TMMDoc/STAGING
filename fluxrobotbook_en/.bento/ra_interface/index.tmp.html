<div class="paragraph">
<p>In compliance with the safety regulations of the relevant national standards and laws as well as the additional safety information in this description, it is also possible to operate the TruBend as usual via the operating panel with manual
loading. We differentiate between the operations "TruBend without robot" and
"TruBend with robot".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When operating without a robot, the TruBend is loaded manually. For this purpose, the press brake is controlled with the operating panel. This setup status corresponds to the description in the operator&#8217;s manual of
the press brake.</p>

<p>During operation with a robot, the sheet is guided by the robot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you select the operating mode "TruBend with robot", the foot switch
is partially inactive, e.g. the "PRESS BEAM DOWN" foot switch has no
function. Therefore, in robot mode it is not possible to trigger a movement of the press beam with the foot switch.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Operating-mode key switch</strong> As standard the external operating-mode key
switch is used to switch between operation with and without robot. The operating-mode key switch is located next to the On/Off switch.</p>
