<pre>EtherCAT is a protocol suitable for both hard and soft real-time computing
requirements in automation technology.It is governedby the EtherCATTechnology
Group.
EtherCAT operates by sending a telegram that passes through each node. Each
EtherCAT device reads the data addressed to it and inserts its data into the frame
as it moves downstream. The last node in a segment detects an open port and
sends the message back to the master using full-duplex Ethernet technology.
Many types of topologies are supported by EtherCAT, such as line, tree, star, and
daisy-chain.</pre>

<pre>EtherCAT uses ESI files for configuration. The ESI file that comes with the device
is XML based and contains the complete description of its network accessible
properties, such as process data andtheir mappingoptions,the supportedmailbox
protocols including optional features, as well as the supported modes of
synchronization. The ESI file is used to set up the communication between the
PLC/controller and the devices.</pre>
