<p>EtherCAT is a protocol suitable for both hard and soft real-time computing
requirements in automation technology.It is governedby the EtherCATTechnology
Group.
EtherCAT operates by sending a telegram that passes through each node. Each
EtherCAT device reads the data addressed to it and inserts its data into the frame
as it moves downstream. The last node in a segment detects an open port and
sends the message back to the master using full-duplex Ethernet technology.
Many types of topologies are supported by EtherCAT, such as line, tree, star, and
daisy-chain.</p>
