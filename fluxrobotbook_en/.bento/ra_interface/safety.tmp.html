<p>There are serious dangers when operating a robot</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A robot can be connected to the machine via the interface pro
vided for this purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The press beam moves at rapid speed and the robot moves.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The user must secure the machine and the robot in such a
way as to prevent any persons from entering the danger
zone (e.g. using safety fencing). Observe the national safety
regulations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The robot is started up while the operator is located within
the danger zone of the robot!</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure that a parking position has been set up for the
robot for stand-alone operation.</p>

<p>It may be that "EMERGENCY STOP" push-button does not
work!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Before activating the robot, download the safety CPU option.Safety chapter from Trumpf manuals</p>

<p>Also always leave the operating panel plugged in during the robot mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EMERGENCY STOP circuit is active, i.e. the "EMERGENCY STOP"
push-button is fully functional. If an operating unit with foot switches
is plugged in, then this EMERGENCY STOP is also active at all times,
since all "EMERGENCY STOP" buttons are connected in series in a circuit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a TruBend press brake the operating unit with foot switches is
always plugged in in the same way with or without robot interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a robot is not connected, the EMERGENCY STOP circuit of the robot
interface is bridged at plug XS8 with the dummy plug</p>
